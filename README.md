## Overview 🏗️

**[kloverbuy.com](https://kloverbuy.com/)** is my first DevOps project, where I learned and implemented a CI/CD flow using **Jenkins**. This project was part of my freelance role as a Server Administrator at **G Tech Websolutions** during my undergraduate studies. 

I successfully created pipelines for both development and production environments. With this setup:
- Developers only need to **commit their code**, and the Jenkins pipeline automatically deploys it to the server's project directory.
- **Deployment time was reduced by 55%**, as developers no longer had to manually upload files via FTP.

To empower the construction industry by providing a seamless and efficient marketplace where professionals can:
- Access the best products.
- Share knowledge.
- Thrive in their projects.

We strive to innovate and meet the ever-evolving needs of the construction sector.
